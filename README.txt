Apriori Implementation

This code uses the apriori algorithm to data mine the given files. It is also capable of generating new data sets to mine. Be careful when running it -- Running time is on the order of several days, and I've never seen this program actually generate all the way up to five datasets. Completed for a Data Structures & Algorithms class at Champlain College in 2013. Code copyright Scott Barrett, Jack Storm, and David Johnston.
